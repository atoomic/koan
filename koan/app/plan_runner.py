"""
Kōan -- Plan runner.

Generates structured implementation plans and posts them as GitHub issues
or comments. Extracted from the /plan skill handler so it can run as a
queued mission via run.py instead of inline in the bridge process.

Issue-centric workflow:
  - New idea: search for existing plan issue first, update if found, create if not
  - Existing issue URL: read all comments, produce updated plan, post as comment
  - Always reuse existing issues to keep the conversation in one place

CLI:
    python3 -m app.plan_runner --project-path <path> --idea "Add dark mode"
    python3 -m app.plan_runner --project-path <path> --issue-url <url>
    python3 -m app.plan_runner --project-path <path> --issue-url <url> --base-branch main
