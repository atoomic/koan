"""Self-healing watchdog for the Telegram bridge process.

The bridge (``awake.py``) is a long-running process with no wrapper, so
a frozen ``sys.modules`` after an ``/update`` leaves it serving stale
imports until someone with shell access kicks it.  The runner, by
contrast, has a wrapper that relaunches it on every exit — so it is
*always* fresh code.  This module gives the runner the responsibility
of watching the bridge and recovering it when something goes wrong.

Two failure modes are detected:

1.  **Stale modules** — the process is alive and the heartbeat is fresh,
    but ``sys.modules`` has not been reloaded after a code update.
    Caught by stamping the bridge's git HEAD at startup and comparing
    against the on-disk HEAD on each runner iteration.

2.  **Hung / dead bridge** — the heartbeat goes stale or the PID file
    is gone / pointing at a dead PID.

Recovery is escalated through four tiers so we never go straight from
"unhealthy" to ``SIGKILL``:

    Tier 1  request_restart() — let the bridge re-exec itself
    Tier 2  SIGTERM the bridge PID
    Tier 3  SIGKILL + pid_manager.start_awake() — last resort
    Tier 4  circuit-broken — stop trying, write a loud alert

State persists between calls in ``instance/.koan-bridge-heal-state``
so each runner iteration knows what's already been attempted.
