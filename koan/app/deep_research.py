"""
Kōan Deep Research — Intelligent topic selection for DEEP mode

Instead of defaulting to "add tests" or generic refactoring,
this module analyzes project state and suggests priority topics.

Inputs:
- priorities.md: Human-defined focus areas and constraints
- GitHub issues: Open issues for actionable work
- Recent journal: What was recently done (avoid duplicates)
- learnings.md: Known patterns and debt

Output:
- A prioritized list of suggested topics for DEEP mode work
- Reasoning for why each topic is relevant now

Usage:
    deep_research.py <instance_dir> <project_name> <project_path>

Returns JSON with suggested topics and reasoning.
