"""Reuse decision for repeated reviews (spec 010, US1, FR-001).

When a PR is reviewed again with an identical head AND base (merge-base) SHA and
an equivalent review request, the prior review is *reproduced* instead of
re-derived — eliminating run-to-run drift on unchanged code (the "keeps finding
different issues" frustration).

Pure, deterministic helpers only: the runner supplies the current SHAs, the
request signature, and the persisted prior-review record; this module just
decides whether reuse is warranted and provides the reader-facing reproduction
marker. Any missing/mismatched piece -> no reuse (fall back to a fresh review,
FR-007), so the decision is fail-safe by construction.
