"""
Kōan — Feature tip system.

Proactively surfaces one undiscovered skill to the user via Telegram
each time the agent enters idle sleep, increasing feature adoption.

Smart selection: tracks which skills the user has actually used (90 days)
and which hints were recently shown (7 days). Prioritizes key development
skills the user hasn't tried, and avoids repeating hints.

Throttled: at most once every 6 hours.
