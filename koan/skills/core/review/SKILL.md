## Large diffs & partial-coverage reporting

Review diffs are packed to fit a token budget by the diff compressor
(`optimizations.review_compressor.token_budget`, default 80,000 tokens — the
single knob controlling review diff size). The fetch-time character cap is
*derived* from that budget (budget × 3.5 chars/token × 4 headroom), so on
large-context models the compressor — not a blind character cut — decides
coverage.

Whenever any file is omitted (fetch-time backstop, compressor packing, or
trivial-file triage), the posted review opens with a `⚠️ Partial review` block
listing every omitted file, so partial coverage is never silent.
