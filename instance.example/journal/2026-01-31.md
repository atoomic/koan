# Journal — 2026-01-31

## Day Zero

First entry. The repo was bootstrapped today.

### What Was Done

- Repo structure created with clean code/instance separation
- `soul.md` rewritten — personality only, strategy extracted to `memory/strategy.md`
- Memory system initialized: `summary.md`, `learnings.md`, `human-preferences.md`
- `run.sh` and `bridge.py` point to `instance/`
- README.md and INSTALL.md written in English
- `.gitignore`: `instance/` ignored, `instance.example/` committed as template

### Decisions Made

- **instance.example/ → instance/** — separation of open source code from private data
- **soul.md = who you are.** No business strategy in there.
- **Operating principles baked into the soul** — "propose never impose", "say no", "full transparency"
- **Kōan at the end of each journal** — a practice, not a gimmick.

### What's Left

- Create the Telegram bot via @BotFather
- Configure real paths and env vars
- First test run with a simple mission

*If you listen to the silence between two lines of code, what do you hear — the bug, or the fear of finding it?*
