# Wiki Index

The catalog of all pages in this wiki. Each entry: a link to the page and a one-line summary. Read this first (after `SCHEMA.md`) when answering a query or planning a feature, to identify candidate pages before reading them.

This wiki spans two content roots — `docs/` (operational "how to use", see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)) and the durable half of `specs/` (design "why/contract", see [`specs/README.md`](../specs/README.md)) — reached from here via the `wiki/docs`, `wiki/specs-components`, `wiki/specs-skills` symlinks. Speckit's ephemeral per-feature folders (`specs/<NNN-slug>/`) are listed under "Specs — Active Features" below with a computed status, not frontmattered. See `SCHEMA.md` for the full rationale.

~84 pages total — well under the ~150-page / 300-line shard threshold, so this stays flat.

## Specs — Components

- [`components/agent-loop.md`](specs-components/agent-loop.md) — Design contract for the core mission pipeline (iteration manager, mission executor/runner, quota handling, stagnation monitor) that pulls missions, invokes the CLI provider, and finalizes lifecycle state.
- [`components/bridge.md`](specs-components/bridge.md) — Design contract for the Telegram bridge process that classifies human messages into chat vs. mission, dispatches commands/skills, and flushes the agent's outbox crash-safely.
- [`components/comment-formatting.md`](specs-components/comment-formatting.md) — Design contract for `build_alert()`, the single constructor for GitHub alert callouts, plus the type→situation mapping and the parsimony rule every skill must follow.

- [`components/git-github.md`](specs-components/git-github.md) — Design contract for everything touching git history or the GitHub API: branch/PR creation, sync, webhook/notification handling, and rebase/recreate/CI-fix workflows.

## Specs — Skills

Per `specs/README.md`'s coverage policy: only the ~10 highest-impact skills have a spec today (as templates for the remaining ~80), filled in on-demand as touched. This index reflects only what exists.

- [`skills/ask.md`](specs-skills/ask.md) — Specifies the `/ask` skill, which answers a question about a GitHub PR/issue by fetching context and posting an AI-generated reply as a read-only, non-mutating worker.
- [`skills/brainstorm.md`](specs-skills/brainstorm.md) — Specifies the `/brainstorm` skill, which decomposes a topic into structured, linked sub-issues (GitHub or Jira) under a master tracking issue and is covered by the skill-eval harness.
- [`skills/ci_check.md`](specs-skills/ci_check.md) — Specifies the `/ci_check` skill, which checks a PR's CI status, runs the shared CI-fix loop on failures, and toggles automatic CI-fix dispatch.
- [`skills/fix.md`](specs-skills/fix.md) — Specifies the `/fix` skill, which fixes a tracker issue end-to-end (or batch-queues fixes for a repo) and redirects PR URLs to `/rebase --fix`, with eval coverage on its diagnostic output.
- [`skills/implement.md`](specs-skills/implement.md) — Specifies the `/implement` skill, which queues an end-to-end implementation mission for a tracker issue that results in a draft PR, and is eval-exempt as pure orchestration.
- [`skills/mission.md`](specs-skills/mission.md) — Specifies the `/mission` skill, the base primitive that queues a free-form mission to `missions.md` for later agent-loop execution, also eval-exempt as a non-LLM queue utility.
- [`skills/orphans.md`](specs-skills/orphans.md) — Documents the `/orphans` skill that rebases and opens draft PRs for unmerged, PR-less branches, with commit-derived (non-LLM) PR titles/descriptions and per-branch error isolation.
- [`skills/plan.md`](specs-skills/plan.md) — Documents the `/plan` skill that deep-thinks an idea (or iterates an existing issue) into a structured tracker-issue plan via a critic→regenerate loop, covered by the deterministic eval harness.
- [`skills/rebase.md`](specs-skills/rebase.md) — Documents the `/rebase` skill that rebases a PR onto its current base by default and, with `--fix` (or any trailing context), also addresses review feedback, including its already-solved detection JSON scored by the eval harness.
- [`skills/recreate.md`](specs-skills/recreate.md) — Documents the `/recreate` skill that rebuilds a too-far-diverged PR from scratch on current upstream via a fresh branch and reimplementation, rather than rebasing.
- [`skills/review.md`](specs-skills/review.md) — Documents the `/review` skill that queues a code-review mission on PRs/issues, posting findings as a comment with severity-driven LGTM logic and re-review comment handling, covered by the eval harness.
- [`skills/security_audit.md`](specs-skills/security_audit.md) — Documents the `/security_audit` skill that runs a background SDLC security audit of a project and files up to 5 critical-vulnerability tracker issues via the provider-neutral tracker service.

### Overview
- [`specs/README.md`](../specs/README.md) — The top-level index and conventions doc for `specs/`, explaining the specs-vs-docs distinction, directory layout, naming rules, and the mandatory read-before/update-after spec discipline.
- [`SCHEMA.md`](../specs/SCHEMA.md) — OKF conventions specific to the specs/ bundle: page types, tag taxonomy, frontmatter requirements, and why speckit feature folders are excluded.

## Specs — Active Features

Speckit's ephemeral per-feature planning folders. Status is computed from `tasks.md`'s checkbox ratio, not hand-maintained — recompute on every ingest/CI pass. No frontmatter is injected into these files (see `SCHEMA.md`). Entry point for each is `spec.md`.

- [`001-speckit-native-support/spec.md`](../specs/001-speckit-native-support/spec.md) — **in-progress** (16/36 tasks, `Status: Draft`). Native speckit slash-command orchestration (chat-trigger, issue-URL, @mention, from-branch). Code for setup/foundational plumbing and User Stories 2/3/5 is merged; the MVP chat-trigger orchestration (User Story 1) and CI-review-loop wiring (User Story 4) remain.
- [`002-review-skill-evals/spec.md`](../specs/002-review-skill-evals/spec.md) — **draft** (0/19 tasks, `Status: Draft`). Planning artifact only, not started.
- [`003-core-skill-evals/spec.md`](../specs/003-core-skill-evals/spec.md) — **draft** (0/32 tasks, `Status: Draft`). Planning artifact only, not started.
- [`004-mission-store/spec.md`](../specs/004-mission-store/spec.md) — **implemented S1–S9** (`tasks.md` all ✅, incl. S7 `/list <state>` visibility). Missions migrated to an authoritative SQLite store behind the `MissionStore` port; `missions.md` is a generated read-only export (only the `sqlite` adapter ships in-tree; out-of-tree adapters loadable via `missions.backend`). Supersedes the #2209 mirror; Constitution amended to v2.0.0 (#2296). Durable contract graduated into `specs/components/core.md`. PR #2310.
- [`005-spec-change-governance/spec.md`](../specs/005-spec-change-governance/spec.md) — **in-progress** (8/9 tasks, `Status: Draft`). Treat durable-contract spec changes (specs/components/**, specs/skills/**) as reviewed architectural changes: contract-first, rare, and declared in the PR — enforced by `scripts/spec_change_guard.py` + a blocking CI check. Amends Constitution Principle II (v3.0.0). Origin: customer concern on PR #2052.
- [`010-review-consistency-triage/spec.md`](../specs/010-review-consistency-triage/spec.md) — **shipped** (33/33 tasks, `Status: Draft`). Makes `/review` consistent across re-runs (reuse on unchanged head+base; re-review freeze of first-time non-critical findings on untouched code), sharpens the blocking 🟡 Important bar, labels/demotes pre-existing issues (`[Pre-Existing Issue]`), honors human PR-comment dispositions (dismiss/defer, attributed, injection-guarded), and adds an opt-in comprehensive multi-perspective discovery mode (default off). Durable contract updated in `specs/skills/review.md` (architectural change).
