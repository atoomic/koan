# OpenAI Codex CLI Provider

The Codex provider lets Kōan use OpenAI's Codex CLI as the underlying
AI agent. This is useful if you have a ChatGPT Pro (or Plus/Business/
Enterprise) subscription and want to use Codex models (GPT-5.4,
GPT-5.3-Codex, etc.) for planning and autonomous work.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Codex CLI

```bash
# npm (all platforms)
npm install -g @openai/codex

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask codex

# Verify
codex --version
```

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
# Browser-based login (default)
codex

# API key login
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key

# Headless / SSH
codex login --device-auth
```

You need a ChatGPT account with an active subscription that includes
Codex access (Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, or Enterprise).

### 3. Configure Kōan

**Option A: config.yaml** (persistent)

```yaml
cli_provider: "codex"
```

**Option B: Environment variable** (per-session)

```bash
export KOAN_CLI_PROVIDER=codex
```

The env var overrides config.yaml if both are set.

### 4. Model Selection

Set the model in your config.yaml `models:` section. Codex models use
their full names:

```yaml
models:
  mission: "gpt-5.4"           # Main mission execution
  chat: "gpt-5.4-mini"         # Chat responses (faster, cheaper)
  lightweight: "gpt-5.4-mini"  # Low-cost calls
  review_mode: "gpt-5.3-codex" # Autonomous review mode and /review analysis
  fallback: ""                  # Not supported by Codex (ignored)
```

Available models (as of March 2026):
- `gpt-5.4` — Flagship frontier model (recommended)
- `gpt-5.4-mini` — Fast, cost-effective for lighter tasks
- `gpt-5.3-codex` — Industry-leading coding model
- `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` — Near-instant iteration (Pro only)

## How It Works

Kōan invokes Codex in **non-interactive mode** via `codex exec`:

```
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --model gpt-5.4 "Your prompt here"
```

This runs Codex as a scripted agent that reads the project, generates
a plan, executes it, and returns the result. Streaming skill calls use
`--json` for progress events and `--output-last-message` for the final
assistant response, so Kōan can show live activity without relying on
Codex event shapes for the final answer.

### Stream Completion (`task_complete` hang mitigation)

Codex sometimes emits its final answer and a `task_complete` event but then
keeps the `codex exec` process alive instead of exiting. A naive reader that
waits for stdout EOF would block indefinitely, so the skill that launched
Codex (e.g. `/review`, `/plan`) could never commit, push, or finalize.

Kōan treats `task_complete` as a **logical terminal event**:

1. When the event arrives, Kōan keeps reading for a short grace period so a
   process that is about to exit cleanly still does.
2. If the process is still alive after the grace window, Kōan terminates the
   Codex process group and returns the captured final message, logging
   `provider emitted terminal event but did not exit` to stderr.
3. If a provider **error** event (`error`, `turn.failed`, `response.failed`,
   `task.failed`) was seen at any point, completion is *not* treated as
   successful — the run still surfaces as a failure.

The Codex child is started in its own process group (`start_new_session=True`)
so this terminate step kills only the Codex tree, never the Kōan skill process
that is waiting to return. A normal, finite stream is unaffected: it reaches
EOF before the grace logic engages and returns exactly as before.

### Process-group teardown contract (all stream-json providers)

The streaming path (`run_command_streaming`) runs *inside* a skill subprocess
that `run.py` spawns and monitors. Isolating the provider into its own process
group (above) is required so the streamer's internal kill doesn't take down the
skill subprocess — but it also hides the provider from `run.py`'s teardown of
that skill subprocess (`kill_process_group()` targets the skill's group, not the
provider's). Left unaddressed, a `/abort` or a liveness/duration watchdog would
kill the skill subprocess while orphaning the provider CLI.

To close that gap the provider child is also armed with a **parent-death
signal** (`prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL)`, wired via `popen_cli`'s
`parent_death_signal` argument). The kernel then SIGKILLs the provider the
moment its skill subprocess dies — for any reason, including a hard kill where
no userspace handler could run. This is **Linux-only** (production runs on
Linux); on macOS dev there is no `prctl`, and the provider instead dies via
`SIGPIPE` on its next stdout write after the skill subprocess exits. The same
contract applies to the `claude` provider and to `claude_step` (used by
`/rebase`, `/recreate`, PR review).

### Streaming timeouts: idle vs max-duration

Streaming runs are bounded by two **independent** deadlines:

- **max-duration** (`timeout`) — a hard wall-clock cap on total runtime.
- **idle timeout** (`idle_timeout`) — an inactivity cap that **resets on every
  streamed line**, so an actively-working session is never killed merely for
  taking a long time; only genuine silence trips it. `None`/`0` disables it.

This matters for long-but-active sessions like large PR reviews. `/review` uses
a generous max-duration with a separate idle deadline, configurable via:

| Config key            | Default                        | Meaning                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `review_max_duration` | `skill_timeout` (7200s)        | Hard cap on total review runtime |
| `review_idle_timeout` | `first_output_timeout` (600s)  | Silence cap (resets per line)    |

(`/plan` and `/ai` pass only a max-duration; they leave `idle_timeout` unset.)

### Execution Modes

| Kōan Setting          | Codex Flag       | Behavior                        |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| `skip_permissions: false` | `--sandbox workspace-write` | Workspace writes, but `.git` may be read-only |
| `skip_permissions: true`  | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` | No approvals, no sandbox |

### Usage Estimation And Internal Budget Gates

Koan tracks token usage from Codex JSON output when available. This internal
estimate drives autonomous mode downgrades (`deep` -> `implement` -> `review`
-> `wait`) but is separate from hard provider quota detection.

Recognized Codex JSONL usage events are:

- `turn.completed` events with a `usage` object.
- `event_msg` rollout events where `payload.type` is `token_count` and
  `payload.info.total_token_usage` contains the token counters.

In both formats, Koan treats `cached_input_tokens` as cache-read tokens and
subtracts them from counted input tokens before updating the internal budget.
When multiple usage-bearing events are present, the latest snapshot wins.

For Codex subscription accounts where you want to ignore internal estimates and
only react to real provider quota/session-limit errors, set:

```yaml
usage:
  budget_mode: disabled
```

With `budget_mode: disabled`, Koan still detects provider quota exhaustion from
Codex stderr and structured error events, and will still pause + requeue on
hard quota failures.

## Per-Project Override

You can use Codex for specific projects while keeping Claude as the
default. In `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  my-openai-project:
    path: "/path/to/project"
    cli_provider: "codex"
    models:
      mission: "gpt-5.4"
      chat: "gpt-5.4-mini"
```

## MCP Configuration

Codex configures MCP servers via `~/.codex/config.toml` (not CLI flags):

```toml
[mcp_servers.github]
command = ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
```

Kōan's `--mcp-config` flags are silently ignored when using the Codex
provider. Configure MCP servers directly in Codex's config.

## AGENTS.md

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` files from the project root (similar to
Claude's `CLAUDE.md`). If your project already has a `CLAUDE.md`,
consider symlinking or adapting it:

```bash
ln -s CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### "codex: command not found"

Install the CLI: `npm install -g @openai/codex`

### Authentication errors

Re-authenticate: `codex login --device-auth`

When debugging Kōan, test the same non-interactive path Kōan uses. A short
plain command like `codex exec 'say hello'` can succeed while the daemon path
fails during JSON streaming, stdin prompt passing, or final-message capture:

```bash
printf 'say hello' | codex exec --json --output-last-message /tmp/koan-codex-last-message --sandbox workspace-write -
```

If Kōan runs as a background service, also verify that the service user has the
same `HOME`, `PATH`, `.codex/auth.json`, and `.env` values as your interactive
shell. Restart Kōan after re-authenticating so the daemon uses the refreshed
Codex auth state.

Kōan serializes its own Codex CLI subprocesses to avoid concurrent token-refresh
races between preflight probes, message formatting, and long-running review
sessions. If Codex still reports `401 Unauthorized` or refresh-token reuse, Kōan
will pause for auth and requeue the active mission instead of marking it failed.

### Rate limits

Codex shares quota with your ChatGPT subscription. If you hit limits,
Kōan's quota detection will pause and notify you. Codex quota detection is
provider-specific: Kōan trusts Codex/OpenAI error events and stderr, but does
not scan normal command output for generic billing or credit words. Token
accounting failures and quota detection are separate: if usage extraction
fails for a mission, Koan still runs quota detection for that mission.

### Tool restrictions not working

Codex does not support per-tool allow/disallow flags. Tool access is
controlled by sandbox policies. Use `skip_permissions: true` (maps to
`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`) for full access, or the
default `--sandbox workspace-write` for workspace-scoped writes. In some
deployments, `workspace-write` allows source edits but mounts `.git`
read-only; use full access only when Kōan already runs in a trusted
external sandbox and Codex should create branches, commits, pushes, and PRs.

### System prompt not taking effect

Codex does not have a `--append-system-prompt` flag. System prompts
are prepended to the user prompt as a workaround. This means they
don't benefit from Codex's separate instruction caching.
