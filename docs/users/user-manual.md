## Beginner — Daily Basics

Everything you need to use Kōan day-to-day. If you've just installed Kōan, start here.

### Your First Mission

Send a message to Kōan via Telegram (or Slack). If it looks like a task, Kōan automatically queues it as a mission:

> *"Audit the auth module for security issues"*

For explicit control, use the `/mission` command:

```
/mission Refactor the payment service to use async/await
```

**`/mission`** — Queue a new mission for the agent to work on.

- **Usage:** `/mission <description>`
- **Options:**
  - `/mission --now <description>` — Insert at the top of the queue (next to run)
  - `/mission [project:webapp] <description>` — Target a specific project

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/mission Add input validation to the signup form` — Queue a feature task
- `/mission --now Fix the broken CI pipeline` — Urgent fix, skip the queue
- `/mission [project:api] Write integration tests for the /users endpoint` — Target a specific project
</details>

### Mission Lifecycle

Every mission flows through a simple lifecycle:

```
Pending  →  In Progress  →  Done ✓
                          →  Failed ✗
```

1. **Pending** — Queued and waiting. Kōan picks missions from the top of the queue.
2. **In Progress** — Kōan is actively working on it via the configured CLI provider.
3. **Done** — Completed successfully. Code is in a `koan/*` branch, often with a draft PR.
4. **Failed** — Something went wrong. Kōan logs the reason and moves on.

By default, Kōan processes one mission at a time. When idle, it picks the next pending mission automatically. For concurrent execution, see [Parallel Sessions](#parallel-sessions).

### Chatting with Kōan

Just send a regular message — Kōan classifies it automatically. Short conversational messages get instant replies (chat mode). Task-like messages get queued as missions.

**Bare skill shortcut:** if the first word of a plain message is the name (or alias) of a core skill, Kōan treats the whole message as that slash command — `time` runs `/time`, `review <url>` runs `/review <url>`. Only core skills trigger this; custom/instance skills do not. If a common word collides with a skill name and you meant to chat, prefix with `/chat`.

If Kōan misclassifies your message, use `/chat` to force chat mode:

**`/chat`** — Force a message to be treated as chat, not a mission.

- **Usage:** `/chat <message>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/chat What do you think about using Redis for caching?` — Ask for an opinion without creating a mission
- `/chat How's your day going?` — Just talk
</details>

### Managing Your Queue

**`/list`** — See all pending and in-progress missions.

- **Aliases:** `/queue`, `/ls`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/list` — Check what's queued up before adding more work
- `/ls` — Quick glance at the queue
</details>

**`/cancel`** — Remove a pending mission from the queue.

- **Usage:** `/cancel <number>` or `/cancel <keyword>`
- **Aliases:** `/remove`, `/clear`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/cancel 3` — Cancel the 3rd pending mission
- `/cancel auth` — Cancel the mission matching "auth"
</details>

**`/abort`** — Abort the current in-progress mission and move to the next one.

- **Usage:** `/abort`
- The running Claude subprocess is killed, the mission is moved to Failed, and the agent loop picks the next pending item.

**`/priority`** — Move a pending mission to a different position in the queue.

- **Usage:** `/priority <n>` (move to top) or `/priority <n> <position>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/priority 5` — Move mission #5 to the top of the queue
- `/priority 3 2` — Move mission #3 to position #2
</details>

### Checking Progress

**`/status`** — Get a quick overview of Kōan's state: what's running, what's queued, loop health.

- **Aliases:** `/st`
- **Related:** `/ping` (is the loop alive?), `/usage` (detailed quota), `/metrics` (success rates), `/version` or `/v` (version only)

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/status` — "Is Kōan working? What's it doing?"
- `/ping` — Quick health check
- `/metrics` — See mission success/failure rates
</details>

**`/brief`** — Daily digest combining pending missions, recent completions, quota health, and journal highlights in one message.

- **Aliases:** `/digest`
- **Flags:** `--schedule` seeds the daily auto-delivery chain (via event scheduler)

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/brief` — Quick morning overview: what happened, what's queued, how's quota
- `/brief --schedule` — Start daily auto-delivery at 07:00 (self-rescheduling)
- Copy `instance.example/events/daily-brief.json` to `instance/events/` and update `run_at` for custom timing
</details>

**`/live`** — See real-time progress from the currently running mission.

- **Aliases:** `/progress`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/live` — Check what Kōan is doing right now during a long mission
</details>

**`/logs [run|awake|all]`** — Show the last 20 lines from log files, formatted in code blocks.

- **Default:** Shows only `run.log`. Use `awake` for bridge logs, `all` for both.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/logs` — Quick check of recent agent output (run.log only)
- `/logs awake` — Check bridge/Telegram polling output
- `/logs all` — See both run and awake logs
</details>

**`/quota [remaining_%]`** — Check remaining API quota (live, no cache), or override the internal estimate.

- **Aliases:** `/q`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/quota` — See how much API budget is left before adding heavy missions, plus the rolling burn rate (%/h) and estimated time to exhaustion
- `/quota 32` — Tell Kōan it has 32% remaining (fixes drift when internal estimate is wrong)
- If Kōan is paused due to quota but the API is actually available, `/quota 50` will correct the estimate and clear the pause
- When the burn rate predicts session exhaustion in less than 30 min, the autonomous mode is automatically downgraded one tier (deep→implement→review). A Telegram alert fires once when projected exhaustion is under 60 min and the next quota reset is still more than 2 h away.
</details>

**`/check_notifications`** — Force an immediate check of GitHub and Jira notifications, bypassing the exponential backoff timer.

- **Aliases:** `/read`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/read` — When the queue is empty and you know there are pending notifications
- `/check_notifications` — After posting a GitHub comment that should trigger a mission
</details>

**`/inbox`** — Force a GitHub notification check and show how many GitHub-originated missions are queued. Works while paused — notifications are fetched inline and missions queue for pickup after resume.

GitHub polling also scans configured repositories for open PRs that still
request the bot as reviewer. If GitHub does not expose a review request through
the notifications API, Kōan still queues `/review <pr-url>` from the PR's
requested-reviewer state. To limit API usage, each repo is rescanned at most
once per `github.review_scan_interval_minutes` (default 15; set `0` to scan
every cycle).

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/inbox` — Quick check: "do I have GitHub mail?" — triggers a fetch and shows pending mission count
- `/inbox` while paused — Fetch notifications even during quota pause; queued missions run after resume
</details>

**`/verbose`** / **`/silent`** — Toggle real-time progress updates. When verbose is on, Kōan sends progress messages as it works.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/verbose` — Turn on updates when you want to follow along
- `/silent` — Turn off updates when you're busy (default)
</details>

**`/messaging_level [debug|normal]`** (alias `/msglevel`) — Show or set the bridge verbosity tier. `normal` (the default) is quiet: failures, command replies, and one-line PR results still come through, but per-mention queue lines and mission-start chatter are collapsed or suppressed. `debug` restores the full lifecycle firehose. Distinct from `/verbose` (which toggles in-mission progress). Every suppressed message is still written to the logs. See [Quieter bridge](#quieter-bridge) and `docs/messaging/messaging-level.md`.

#### Quieter bridge

By default Kōan's bridge runs in `normal` mode — quiet and operator-focused. Set `messaging.level: debug` in `config.yaml`, run `/messaging_level debug`, or export `KOAN_MESSAGING_LEVEL=debug` to restore the legacy chatty behavior. Precedence: env var > `/messaging_level` runtime override > `config.yaml` > `normal`.

With `messaging.level=normal`, each skill mission emits a single status line — the PR/issue URL on success (e.g. `✅ Reviewed https://github.com/o/r/pull/2098`) or a short context string on failure — instead of the step-by-step play-by-play (`Reviewing PR…`, `Analyzing code changes…`, `Posting review…`). Switch to `debug` (`/messaging_level debug`) to see every intermediate progress line again; suppressed progress is always written to the log regardless.

### Branch Isolation & Reviewing Work

Kōan **never commits to `main`**. All work happens in `koan/*` branches (the prefix is configurable). After completing a mission, Kōan typically:

1. Creates a branch like `koan/refactor-payment-service`
2. Commits changes with clear messages
3. Pushes the branch and creates a **draft PR**

Draft PR bodies include a Kōan footer with best-effort provider/model
attribution, submitted HEAD, and runtime. This makes it clear which CLI
provider and model produced the implementation.

Your workflow:

```bash
# See what Kōan produced
git log koan/refactor-payment-service

# Review the PR on GitHub
# Merge when you're satisfied — or ask Kōan to iterate
```

**The agent proposes. The human decides.** — You always have the final say.

### Multi-Project Basics

Kōan can manage multiple projects simultaneously. It rotates between them based on queue priority and quota.

**`/projects`** — List all configured projects.

- **Aliases:** `/proj`
- Shows each project's configured issue tracker when set.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/projects` — See which repos Kōan is managing
</details>

**`/tracker`** — Show or configure per-project issue tracker routing.

- **Usage:** `/tracker`
- **Set GitHub:** `/tracker set <project> github [repo:owner/repo] [branch:main]`
- **Set Jira:** `/tracker set <project> jira key:PROJ [type:Task] [branch:11.126]`

This controls where `/plan` creates new tracker issues and how Jira-origin `/fix` and `/implement` resolve the target repo and branch.

Jira project keys are registered per project in `projects.yaml`. The project path can be configured there with `path:` or discovered from `KOAN_ROOT/workspace/<project-name>`. The old `instance/config.yaml jira.projects` mapping is ignored; `/config_check` reports it as a migration warning.

**`/alias`** — Create short aliases for project names. Once set, typing `/<shortcut> <text>` queues a mission tagged with the aliased project.

- **Usage:** `/alias <project> <shortcut>` — create an alias. `/alias` — list all aliases.
- **Examples:** `/alias Template2 tt`, then `/tt fix the build` queues a mission for Template2.

**`/unalias`** — Remove a project alias.

- **Usage:** `/unalias <shortcut>`

**`/focus`** — Lock Kōan to a single project. While focused, it only processes missions for that project and skips exploration/reflection.

- **Usage:** `/focus [duration]` (default: 5 hours)
- **Examples:** `/focus`, `/focus 3h`, `/focus 2h30m`

**`/unfocus`** — Exit focus mode, resume normal multi-project rotation.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/focus` — "I need all attention on the webapp for the next few hours"
- `/focus 1h` — Short focused sprint
- `/unfocus` — "OK, back to normal"
</details>

**`/passive`** — Enter passive (read-only) mode. The agent loop keeps running (heartbeat, GitHub notification polling, Telegram commands) but never executes missions or autonomous work. Missions accumulate as Pending.

- **Usage:** `/passive [duration]` — no duration = indefinite
- **Examples:** `/passive`, `/passive 4h`, `/passive 2h30m`

**`/active`** — Exit passive mode and resume normal execution. Queued missions drain naturally.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/passive` — "I'm at the desk, don't touch anything"
- `/passive 4h` — "Hands off for the next 4 hours"
- `/active` — "I'm done, you can work again"
</details>

### Permanent Focus Mode

Focus mode can be made permanent via config, turning Kōan into a pure mission executor. When enabled, the agent only runs missions you explicitly queue — it never picks up GitHub issues autonomously, never runs contemplative reflection, and never enters DEEP mode. The loop keeps polling Telegram, GitHub notifications, and recurring schedules, so it still wakes up the moment you queue something.

This extends the `/focus` Telegram command (which is time-bounded) into a permanent config-level switch.

- **Enable globally in `instance/config.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  focus: true
  ```
- **Or via environment variable:** `KOAN_FOCUS=1` (takes precedence over `config.yaml`).
- **Per-project in `projects.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  defaults:
    focus: true          # All projects focused by default
  projects:
    myapp:
      focus: false       # Override: allow autonomous work on myapp
  ```
- **Disable:** set back to `false`, or `KOAN_FOCUS=0`.

What continues to run under focus mode:

- Missions queued via `/mission`, GitHub `@mention` commands, and recurring schedules.
- Heartbeat, auto-update, Telegram polling, GitHub notification polling, CI queue drain.

What is disabled:

- DEEP mode (capped at `implement`).
- Contemplative sessions (random reflection rolls are skipped).
- Autonomous exploration (the loop idles with wake-on-mission when no mission is pending).
- The agent prompt's `GitHub Issue Selection` section is replaced with an explicit "do not pick up issues" instruction.

**How it differs from `/passive`:** passive mode blocks all execution (missions sit as Pending until you `/active`). Focus mode keeps the executor running for any mission you queue — it only gates *autonomous work selection*.

**When to use:**

- You want Kōan to act strictly on demand, no surprises on the PR list.
- You're handing off mission dispatch to another system (CI, a team workflow) and want Kōan to be a quiet executor.
- Multi-bot setups where only one instance should pick up issues autonomously.
- Per-project: focus some repos while allowing exploration on others.

## Intermediate — Productivity Workflows

These features turn Kōan from a task runner into a full development workflow partner.

### Code Operations

**`/brainstorm`** — Decompose a broad topic into 3-8 high-leverage GitHub sub-issues grouped under a master tracking issue.

The decomposer runs as a senior-engineer-style ideation pass: it explores the codebase (if provided) or external source, hunts for compounding improvements, and refuses to pad with generic refactors. Every sub-issue body follows this template:

```markdown
## Why This Matters
<leverage rationale — why this is unusual or high-leverage>

## Approach
<concrete implementation strategy, grounded in real files and patterns>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Risks & Caveats
<hidden complexity, operational risk, maintenance burden>

## Scores
- Impact:          ████████░░ 8/10
- Difficulty:      ██████░░░░ 6/10
- Short-Term ROI:  ███████░░░ 7/10
- Long-Term Value: █████████░ 9/10

## Priority
Immediate | Prototype First | Research Further | Skip

## Dependencies
<SUB-N references to other sub-issues, or "None">
```

The master tracking issue then synthesizes the set with three optional sections:

- **Top Ranked** — sub-issues ordered by ROI / feasibility / strategic value, each with a one-line rationale.
- **Fast Wins** — bucketed by horizon: `< 1 day`, `< 1 week`, `< 1 month`.
- **Overall Assessment** — short critical verdict on whether the initiative is worth pursuing and what to prioritize.

- **Usage:** `/brainstorm <topic>`, `/brainstorm <project> <topic>`, `/brainstorm <topic> --tag <label>`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /brainstorm <topic>` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/brainstorm Improve caching strategy for API responses` — Creates 3-8 sub-issues + master issue
- `/brainstorm koan Add observability and monitoring` — Target a specific project
- `/brainstorm Refactor auth module --tag auth-refactor` — With explicit tag for grouping
</details>

**`/plan`** — Deep-think an idea and produce a structured, task-level implementation plan as a tracker issue.

Plans include a **File Map** (table of every file to create/modify/test), **checkbox steps** within each phase (write test → implement → verify → commit), and **actual code blocks** in steps that change code. Each code block is wrapped in a collapsible `<details>` block so the plan stays scannable — readers see step descriptions first and expand the code only when needed. A built-in self-review pass checks spec coverage, scans for placeholders, and verifies name consistency across phases before output. Multi-subsystem ideas trigger a scope check suggesting separate plans per subsystem.

- **Usage:** `/plan [--iterations N] <idea>`, `/plan <project> <idea>`, `/plan <issue-url>` (iterate on existing)
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /plan <idea>` on an issue
- **Option:** `--iterations N` (1-5, default 1) — Run N rounds of critique+refine. A critic identifies gaps and contradictions after each generation, then the plan is regenerated with that feedback. Only the final iteration is posted. Cost scales linearly (~5× tokens at `--iterations 3`).

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/plan Add WebSocket support for real-time notifications` — Get a phased plan before writing any code
- `/plan --iterations 3 Add WebSocket support` — Generate a plan with 3 rounds of critic-driven refinement
- `/plan https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Iterate on an existing issue's plan
- `/plan https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` — Iterate on a Jira issue's plan
- `/plan https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123 branch:main` — Iterate with an explicit base-branch hint
- `/plan webapp Add rate limiting to public API endpoints` — Target a specific project
</details>

For URL-based `/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/implement`, and `/fix`, Kōan resolves the project
from the issue URL and the known project registry. Known projects include both
`projects.yaml` entries and repositories discovered under `KOAN_ROOT/workspace/`,
so an explicit project prefix is not required when the URL maps to one of
those projects.

For URL-based `/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/implement`, and `/fix`, you can append
`branch:<name>` to override the base branch for that mission (for `/plan` and
`/deepplan`, this is passed as a planning hint in the generated context).

**`/deepplan`** — Spec-first design with Socratic exploration of 2-3 approaches before planning. For complex missions where design matters more than speed.

- **Usage:** `/deepplan <idea>`, `/deepplan <project> <idea>`, `/deepplan <issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/deeplan`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /deepplan <idea>` on an issue

The workflow: (1) explores your codebase and surfaces 2-3 distinct design approaches with trade-offs, (2) runs a spec review loop (up to 5 iterations) to ensure the spec is concrete and complete, (3) posts the approved spec to the configured issue tracker, (4) queues a `/plan <issue-url>` mission for your review and approval.

When given an issue URL, the issue title, body, and all comments are fetched to provide full context for the design exploration.

Use this before `/plan` when the idea is architecturally complex, when you want to explore alternatives before committing, or when design mistakes would be expensive to fix later.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/deepplan Refactor the auth middleware to support OAuth2` — Explore design approaches before writing any code
- `/deepplan koan Add multi-tenant project isolation` — Target a specific project with spec-first design
- `/deepplan https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Deep plan from an existing GitHub issue with full context
- `/deepplan https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` — Deep plan from an existing Jira issue
- `/deepplan Redesign the mission queue for concurrent execution` — Surface trade-offs for a complex architectural change
</details>

**`/implement`** — Queue an implementation mission for a GitHub or Jira issue. Never bails on ambiguity — resolves blockers with the simplest viable solution and retries once before surfacing a problem.

- **Usage:** `/implement <issue-url> [additional context]`
- **Aliases:** `/impl`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /implement` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Implement what the issue describes
- `/implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42 Focus on the backend only` — Add guidance
- `/implement https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123 phase 1 only` — Implement a Jira-backed plan and post the PR link back to Jira
</details>

> **Blocker handling:** When the plan is ambiguous or under-specified, `/implement` chooses the simplest interpretation consistent with existing code patterns, documents the assumption in a commit message, and delivers a draft PR. If the first pass produces no committed changes, an escalated retry pass runs automatically. Only a genuine hard impossibility (no repo access, no actionable plan) results in a soft failure notification.  

After a draft PR is created, `/implement` runs the private review gate when it is enabled (opt-in; disabled by default during the testing phase — set `private_review_gate.enabled: true`). The gate reuses the `/review` analysis path without posting review comments, fixes Blocking/Important findings on the same branch, pushes those fixes, and repeats up to the configured round limit.

**`/fix`** — Fix a GitHub or Jira issue end-to-end: diagnose, understand, plan, test, implement, and submit a PR.

- **Usage:** `/fix <issue-url> [additional context]`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /fix` on an issue
- **Flags:** `--skip-diagnose` — Skip the pre-fix diagnostic step (useful for trivial issues where the root cause is obvious)

Before attempting a fix, `/fix` runs a lightweight read-only diagnostic phase using a smaller model to form a hypothesis about the root cause. The fix session receives this analysis as context. If diagnostic confidence is LOW, a Telegram warning is sent but the fix still proceeds.

After a draft PR is created, `/fix` also runs the private review gate when it is enabled (opt-in; disabled by default during the testing phase). Findings and fix attempts stay backend-only: no review comment, verdict, or issue comment is posted by the gate.

If you point `/fix` at a **PR URL** instead of an issue, it redirects to `/rebase` — addressing review concerns on an existing PR is exactly what `/rebase` does. The `--now` flag and any trailing context are preserved through the redirect.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/fix https://github.com/org/repo/issues/99` — Full bug-fix pipeline (with automatic diagnostic)
- `/fix https://github.com/org/repo/issues/99 Regression from v2.3` — Provide extra context
- `/fix https://github.com/org/repo/issues/99 --skip-diagnose` — Skip diagnostic for a trivial fix
- `/fix https://myorg.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123 branch:main` — Fix a Jira ticket using a one-off target branch
- `/fix https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42 address the security concern` — PR URL redirects to `/rebase`, preserving the trailing context
</details>

**`/debug`** — Structured 4-step debugging when a previous fix attempt failed.

- **Usage:** `/debug <issue-url> [additional context]`
- **Aliases:** `/dbg`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /debug` on an issue
- **Auto-escalation:** Enable `debug_escalation.on_fix_failure: true` in `config.yaml` to automatically queue `/debug` when a `/fix` mission fails.

The debug loop enforces four steps:
1. **Reproduce** — write a minimal failing test before touching production code
2. **Hypothesize** — form and document a specific root cause theory
3. **Minimal fix** — apply the narrowest change that addresses the hypothesis
4. **Verify** — run the reproduction test plus the full suite

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/debug https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Debug a failed fix
- `/debug https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42 check the auth middleware path` — Provide extra context
</details>

**`/review`** — Queue a code review for a pull request or issue.

- **Usage:** `/review <github-pr-or-issue-url> [additional-pr-or-issue-url ...] [--architecture] [--errors] [--comments] [--bot-comments] [--plan-url <issue-url>]`
- **Aliases:** `/rv`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /review` on a PR
- **Multiple URLs:** Queues one independent review mission per PR/issue URL. Shared flags such as `--errors` and `--plan-url <issue-url>` are applied to each queued review.
- **Flags:**
  - `--architecture` — Architecture-focused review (SOLID principles, layering, coupling, abstraction boundaries)
  - `--errors` — Run an additional **silent-failure-hunter** pass that scans for swallowed exceptions, silent null returns, unhandled promises, and other silent error paths. Also auto-triggered when the diff contains error-handling patterns (`try/except`, `catch`, etc.)
  - `--comments` — Comment quality review (factual accuracy, completeness, stale TODOs, misleading language)
  - `--bot-comments` — Triage inline comments from code-review bots (CodeRabbit, Copilot Review, Sourcery) and post replies to actionable findings
- **Output:** Findings are grouped into severity buckets (🔴 Blocking / 🟡 Important / 🟢 Suggestions), each folded into a collapsible section. Every finding's location is shown on its own line inside the summary as a **clickable link** that jumps straight to the exact file and lines on GitHub, pinned to the reviewed commit (so the link stays accurate even after the PR gets new commits).
- **Project memory:** Reviews automatically inject the project's filtered learnings plus human-curated `context.md`/`priorities.md`, ranked against the PR's title, body, and diff via the SQLite FTS5 memory index. Set `review_memory.enabled: true` in `config.yaml` to *also* include recent typed project memory (decisions, observations) for extra reviewer context. Both apply to `/review` and the backend private review gate.
- **Prior review context:** On a re-review, the bot's own most recent structured review is surfaced in a dedicated, head-preserving prompt slot so the new review builds on it (confirming whether prior findings are resolved) instead of losing it to the recency-truncated conversation thread. That prior review is also removed from the thread so it doesn't echo or crowd out human feedback. Tune via `review_context` in `config.yaml` (`include_bot_feedback`, `prior_review_max_chars`).

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55` — Get a thorough code review
- `/rv https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55` — Same thing, shorter
- `/review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/55 --architecture` — Architecture-focused review

- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot ask <your question>` on any PR or issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `@koan-bot ask why does this test fail?` — Kōan investigates the thread context and replies on GitHub
- `@koan-bot ask what is the purpose of this PR?` — Get a structured explanation with context summary
- `/ask https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42#issuecomment-123456` — Reply to a specific comment
</details>

**`/rebase`** — Rebase a PR onto its base branch.

- **Usage:** `/rebase <pr-url> [focus area]`
- **Aliases:** `/rb`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /rebase` on a PR

Any text after the URL is threaded into the mission as extra focus context (e.g. `/rebase <pr-url> address the security concern`). A `/fix` invoked on a PR URL redirects here, preserving that context.

By default, Telegram `/rebase` only queues PRs created by this instance
(branch prefix match). Set `allow_rebase_foreign_prs: true` in
`instance/config.yaml` to allow rebasing other writable PRs.
By default, `/rebase` feedback analysis includes bot-authored comments
(`rebase_include_bot_feedback: true`). Set it to `false` to keep noisy
third-party CI/bot output out of the feedback prompt. Kōan's own comments
are always kept (never treated as bot output), so review feedback it left on
a previous iteration is available to a later rebase — important for combined
review + rebase flows.

After `/rebase` pushes the updated PR branch, it also runs the private
review gate when `private_review_gate` enables `rebase`. The gate reuses the
backend-only `/review` analysis path, fixes Blocking/Important findings on the
same branch, force-pushes any gate fix commits with the normal `/rebase` push
strategy, and re-reviews up to the configured round limit. Gate failures are
reported in the rebase summary but do not fail an otherwise successful rebase.

When `/rebase` runs long, Kōan uses activity-aware limits for review and CI-fix phases: it allows long sessions when CLI output keeps flowing, but still aborts stalled phases after inactivity or a max-duration cap. If the review-feedback step *stalls* (idle/max-duration timeout), Kōan now restores the clean rebased checkpoint and still pushes the rebase (without partial feedback edits), so timeout noise does not discard a valid rebase. If the feedback step hits a *provider quota limit*, the rebase still stops so you can retry after quota reset. Any other transient feedback error remains best-effort and does not block pushing the rebase.

When a target repository pre-commit hook formats files during the feedback
commit, Kōan stages the hook-created edits and retries the commit once. If local
hooks still reject the feedback commit, Kōan commits the feedback with
`--no-verify` so valid review edits are not discarded by broad local gates; CI
remains the final validation. If the feedback step itself still fails, Kōan
pushes the clean rebase and reports that review feedback was not applied instead
of labeling the result as a simple rebase.

After completion, Kōan posts a structured comment on the PR with these sections:

1. **Summary** — Classifies the rebase (simple / with adjustments / with conflict resolution)
2. **Changes applied** — List of modifications beyond the rebase itself (review feedback, conflict resolution, CI fixes)
3. **Stats** — Diff summary (files changed, insertions, deletions)
4. **Actions performed** — Pipeline steps in a collapsible `<details>` block
5. **CI status** — Test/CI outcome

- `/branches koan` — Show branches for a specific project
</details>

**`/checkup`** — Health-check every open PR you authored across all projects. For each PR with merge conflicts it queues a `/rebase`; for each with failing CI it queues a `/check`. Results are deduplicated against already-queued missions and skipped when a PR is unchanged since the last checkup.

- **Usage:** `/checkup`
- **Aliases:** `/checkprs`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/checkup` — Sweep all open PRs and auto-queue fixes for conflicts and CI failures
</details>

**`/orphans`** — Recover orphan branches by rebasing onto the default branch and creating draft PRs.

- **Usage:** `/orphans <project_name>`
- **Aliases:** `/orphan`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

**`/check`** — Run project health checks on a PR or issue (rebase, review, plan as needed).

- **Usage:** `/check <pr-or-issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/inspect`

Kōan also **auto-forwards unresolved human review comments** on its open PRs. During the GitHub notification polling loop, `review_comment_dispatch` checks Kōan-created PRs for new review comments and creates missions to address the feedback — no explicit @mention required. Fingerprint-based deduplication (SHA-256 of sorted comment IDs) prevents re-dispatching the same set of comments. Bot comments are filtered out automatically.

Configure this behavior in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
review_dispatch:
  enabled: true            # Opt-in (default: false)
  cooldown_minutes: 30     # Min minutes between checks per project (default: 30)
  tracker_max_age_days: 30 # Prune dedup entries older than this (default: 30)
```

To prevent the bot from replying to itself in review comment threads (and to cap thread depth), configure:

```yaml
review_reply:
  max_thread_depth: 5      # Stop replying after this many comments per thread (default: 5)
```

When the bot is the last poster in a thread and no human has followed up, the thread is excluded from future replies. This prevents self-reply loops where repeated `/review` runs keep adding replies to the same comment.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/check https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Let Kōan decide what a PR needs
- Reviewer leaves comments on a PR → next notification check creates a mission to address them

**`/check_need`** — Analyze whether a PR or issue is still needed given the current state of the repository.

- **Usage:** `/check_need <pr-or-issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/need`, `/needs`

Fetches the PR diff or issue description, compares it against the current main branch, and posts a detailed relevance analysis as a GitHub comment. The analysis covers whether changes have been superseded, are partially addressed, or remain fully valuable — with specific file-level evidence and a clear recommendation.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/check_need https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` — Check if a PR is still relevant after recent main branch changes

</details>

**`/ci_check`** — Check and fix CI failures on a GitHub PR using Claude.

- **Usage:** `/ci_check <pr-url>` or `/ci_check --enable` / `/ci_check --disable`

Usually auto-triggered when CI fails after a `/rebase`, but can also be invoked manually. Fetches failure logs, checks out the PR branch, and runs Claude to attempt a fix. If the fix produces a commit, it force-pushes and re-enqueues the PR for CI monitoring. Requires `ci_check.enabled: true` in config.yaml (the default).

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

### Scheduling Work

Kōan supports recurring missions that automatically re-queue at set intervals.

**`/daily`** — Schedule a mission to run every day.
- **Usage:** `/daily <text> [project:<name>]`

**`/hourly`** — Schedule a mission to run every hour.
- **Usage:** `/hourly <text> [project:<name>]`

**`/weekly`** — Schedule a mission to run every week.

> **Targeting a project:** the bracketed `[project:<name>]` form is recommended, but a trailing `project:<name>` (no brackets, at the end of the text) is also accepted — e.g. `/daily run the API audit project:webapp`. The same applies to `/every`.

**`/recurring`** — List, manage, or force-run recurring missions. All management actions are sub-commands of `/recurring`.
- **Usage:** `/recurring` (list), `/recurring resume <n>` (re-enable), `/recurring run [n]` (force immediate run), `/recurring pause <n>` (disable), `/recurring cancel <n>` (remove), `/recurring days <n> <days>` (day-of-week filter)
- **Aliases:** —

- `/recurring run 2` — Force an immediate run of mission #2
- `/recurring pause 1` — Temporarily disable mission #1
- `/recurring cancel 2` — Stop a recurring mission
</details>

### Automation Suggestions

When Kōan is idle (no pending missions, not in focus mode), it can proactively suggest recurring tasks tailored to your project. Suggestions are generated using a lightweight model that analyzes project learnings, existing recurring tasks, and patterns from other projects you manage.

Suggestions appear as Telegram messages with copy-pasteable commands — just forward the command back to activate it.

**Configuration** (`config.yaml`):

```yaml
suggestions:
  enabled: true              # Master switch (default: true)
  min_interval_hours: 24     # Cooldown between suggestions per project
  max_per_day: 2             # Daily cap per project
```

Suggestions are automatically deduplicated against existing recurring tasks. The feature only triggers in `implement` or `deep` autonomous modes (when there's enough budget to be useful).

### Ideas Backlog

Not ready to commit to a mission? Save it as an idea.

**`/idea`** — Add an idea to the backlog, or manage existing ideas.

- **Usage:**
  - `/idea <text>` — Add a new idea
  - `/idea <project> <text>` — Add idea for a specific project
  - `/idea promote <n>` — Promote idea #n to a mission
  - `/idea delete <n>` — Delete idea #n

**`/ideas`** — List all ideas in the backlog.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/idea Maybe we should add GraphQL support` — Save for later
- `/ideas` — Browse the backlog
- `/idea promote 3` — "OK, let's do idea #3"
</details>

### Reflection & Journal

**`/reflect`** — Write a reflection to the shared journal. Both you and Kōan contribute to this shared space.

- **Metrics:**
  - **Created** — PRs Kōan opened in the window.
  - **Merged (%)** — of those created, how many are now merged (cohort success rate).
  - **Interacted** — PRs Kōan was involved in (commented, reviewed) updated in the window, including human-authored PRs.
  - **Interacted+merged** — PRs Kōan interacted with that merged during the window.
- **Note:** "Interacted" is sourced from GitHub search (`involves:`). A bare force-push/rebase on a *human-authored* PR (no comment) won't be counted; Kōan's own PRs always are.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/weekly_report` — Monday digest of last week's PR throughput
- `/report --month` — Monthly review across all projects
</details>

### Understanding Quota Modes

Kōan automatically adapts its work intensity based on remaining API quota:

| Mode | Quota | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **DEEP** | >40% | Strategic work, thorough exploration, comprehensive reviews |
| **IMPLEMENT** | 15–40% | Focused development, quick wins, efficient execution |
| **REVIEW** | <15% | Read-only analysis, code audits, lightweight tasks |
| **WAIT** | <5% | Graceful pause until quota resets |

You don't need to manage this — Kōan adjusts automatically. Use `/quota` to see the current mode. If the internal estimate drifts from reality, use `/quota <N>` to override (e.g., `/quota 50` tells Kōan it has 50% remaining).

When the provider reports a hard quota/session limit, Kōan pauses immediately,
moves the current mission back to Pending, and resumes 10 minutes after the
reported reset time. If the reset time cannot be parsed, Kōan pauses for 5
hours.

### Exploration Mode

When exploration is enabled, Kōan may autonomously explore a project's codebase between missions — discovering improvements, noting issues, and building context.

**`/explore`** — Enable exploration or show status.
- **Usage:** `/explore [project|all|none]`
- **Aliases:** `/exploration`

**`/noexplore`** — Disable exploration for a project.
- **Usage:** `/noexplore [project|all]`

Using `all` or `none` also sets the default for future projects added via `/add_project` or workspace discovery.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/explore webapp` — Let Kōan explore the webapp codebase
- `/explore all` — Enable exploration for all projects + set default
- `/noexplore backend` — Disable exploration for one project
- `/noexplore all` — Disable exploration for all projects + set default
</details>

### Autoreview Mode

When autoreview is enabled for a project, Kōan automatically queues `/review <pr-url>` then `/rebase <pr-url>` after any successful mission that creates a PR (and was not auto-merged). This provides an extra quality gate without manual intervention. Off by default.

**`/autoreview`** — Enable autoreview or show status.
- **Usage:** `/autoreview [project|all|none]`
- **Aliases:** `/auto_review`

**`/noautoreview`** — Disable autoreview for a project.
- **Usage:** `/noautoreview [project]`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/autoreview webapp` — Enable autoreview for webapp project
- `/autoreview all` — Enable autoreview for all projects
- `/noautoreview webapp` — Disable autoreview for webapp
</details>

### Workflow Example: Feature from Idea to PR

Here's a typical multi-step workflow combining several commands:

```
1. /idea Add rate limiting to the public API          # Save the idea
2. /idea promote 1                                     # Ready to work on it
3. /plan Add rate limiting to the public API           # Get a structured plan
4. /implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123   # Implement the plan
5. /review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/124        # Review the result
6. # Merge the PR on GitHub when satisfied
```

## Power User — Advanced Configuration

Unlock Kōan's full potential with advanced configuration and extensibility features.

### Parallel Sessions

Kōan can work on multiple missions simultaneously using **git worktrees** for isolation. Each parallel session runs in its own worktree with a dedicated branch, so sessions never interfere with each other.

#### How It Works

When parallel sessions are enabled, Kōan can pick up additional pending missions while one is already running. Each session gets:

- **Isolated worktree** — a separate checkout of the repository under `.worktrees/`
- **Dedicated branch** — `koan/session-<id>` branches created automatically
- **Independent subprocess** — a Claude Code process running in the worktree

Sessions are coordinated through a persistent registry (`instance/sessions.json`) with file-level locking for process safety.

#### Configuration

Add `max_parallel_sessions` to your `instance/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Parallel session configuration
max_parallel_sessions: 2    # Number of concurrent sessions (1-5, default: 2)
```

Set to `1` to disable parallel execution and use the classic sequential mode.

#### Shared Dependencies

To avoid duplicating heavy dependency directories across worktrees, configure `shared_deps` in your project's `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  webapp:
    path: ~/Code/webapp
    shared_deps:
      - node_modules
      - .venv
```

These directories are symlinked from the main project into each worktree, saving disk space and setup time.

> **Note:** Shared deps are best used for read-only caches. If a mission's build step modifies dependencies (e.g., `npm install`), it may affect other sessions sharing the same directory.

#### Monitoring

Parallel sessions appear in the standard status commands:

- **`/status`** — Shows count of active parallel sessions
- **`/live`** — Shows progress of all running sessions

Session output is captured to temporary files and collected when each session completes.

#### Cleanup

Worktrees and session branches are automatically cleaned up when a session finishes (success or failure). On startup, Kōan also recovers stale sessions from previous crashes — marking them as failed and removing their worktrees.

To manually clean up orphaned worktrees:

```bash
# From the project directory
git worktree list    # See all worktrees
git worktree prune   # Remove stale references
```

```

See `instance.example/config.yaml` for all available options.

`usage.budget_mode: disabled` turns off Koan's internal token-budget gating.
Hard provider quota/session-limit errors are still detected from CLI output and
will still pause and requeue missions.

`usage.unlimited_quota: true` is a stronger override: it disables all proactive
quota gating — budget-mode downgrades, burn-rate warnings, and preflight quota
probes. Use this when your CLI provider has no metered quota (e.g. a self-hosted
API proxy or a plan with no hard token limits). If the CLI actually fails with a
quota error, Koan still detects it and pauses.

**`/models`** (alias `/model`) — Show the resolved model configuration for the active CLI provider. Useful when debugging model-routing issues — displays which model wins for each of the 6 slots (`mission`, `chat`, `lightweight`, `fallback`, `review_mode`, `reflect`) after applying the full resolution chain: per-project `models:` → `models.{provider}:` → `models.default:` → built-in defaults.

```
/models
```

The active provider is also shown in `/status` output. See [Provider-specific model config](#provider-specific-model-config) below for how to configure `models.claude:` / `models.codex:` sections.

**`/config_check`** — Detect drift between your `instance/config.yaml` and the template at `instance.example/config.yaml`. Reports two things:

- **Missing keys** — in the template but absent from your config. These are new features released since you last synced and are probably worth reviewing.
- **Extra keys** — in your config but absent from the template. These are usually deprecated/removed settings (or typos).

Run it after every Kōan update to stay in sync:

```
/config_check
```

The same check runs automatically as part of `/doctor` — use `/config_check` when you only want the config slice without the rest of the diagnostic report.

### Health Check & Auto-Repair

**`/doctor`** — Run diagnostic self-checks on configuration, environment, instance structure, processes, projects, and connectivity.

```
/doctor           # Quick diagnostics
/doctor --full    # Include connectivity checks (Telegram, GitHub, CLI)
/doctor --fix     # Auto-repair common issues
```

The `--fix` mode safely repairs:
- **Stale PID files** — removes orphaned PID files when the process is no longer alive
- **Missions.md structural issues** — fixes duplicate headers, foreign sections
- **Stale in-progress missions** — recovers stuck missions back to Pending
- **Missing directories** — creates missing `memory/` and `journal/` directories

When `--fix` is not used, fixable issues are flagged with a hint to re-run with `--fix`.

### Remote HEAD Rescan

**`/rescan`** — Re-check all project workspaces for remote default branch changes (e.g. when a repository renames its default branch from `master` to `main`).

```
/rescan
```

Kōan also checks for remote HEAD changes automatically at startup (throttled to once every 12 hours). Use `/rescan` to force an immediate check across all projects. When a change is detected, the local workspace is updated: the symbolic ref is set, the new branch is fetched and created locally, and if the workspace was on the old branch, it's switched to the new one.

### Caveman Output Optimization

Caveman appends a "no filler, 3–6 word sentences, direct answers" directive to Claude prompts to reduce output tokens.

**Where it applies by default:**

- **Agent loop (regular missions)** — caveman is on by default. This is the highest-volume Claude entry point, so the directive yields the most savings here.
- **Skills and chat — opt-in.** A skill receives caveman only when it explicitly says so. New skills (core or custom) inherit *no* caveman until the author or operator turns it on.

**Core skills shipping with caveman opted in (`caveman: true`)** — these produce terse, status-style output where the directive helps:

| Skill | Why caveman fits |
|-------|------------------|
| `/rebase`, `/recreate`, `/squash` | Git-plumbing skills; output is mostly status |
| `/fix` | Focused issue-fix flow |
| `/debug` | Structured hypothesis-driven debugging |
| `/ci_check` | Diagnostic, action-oriented |
| `/check` | PR/issue check report |
| `/implement` | Mission narration during implementation |

**Core skills shipping with caveman opted out (`caveman: false`)** — terseness directly hurts these (kept explicit for clarity, even though it matches the default):

`/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/review`, `/security_audit`, `/audit`, `/brainstorm`, `/sparring`, `/incident`, `/claudemd`, `/chat`.

**Operator override — the `include:` list:**

```yaml
optimizations:
  caveman:
    enabled: true
    include: [my_custom_skill, deeplan]   # aliases auto-resolved → deepplan
```

Names match **canonical command names**; aliases declared in `koan/app/skill_dispatch.py` (`deeplan` → `deepplan`, `security`/`secu` → `security_audit`, `private_security`/`psecu` → `private_security_audit`, …) resolve automatically. The operator's `include:` list overrides a SKILL.md `caveman: false`, giving instance owners the final say.

**Switching the global flag off** disables caveman everywhere — agent loop included:

```yaml
optimizations:
  caveman:
    enabled: false
```

**Custom skill authors:** add `caveman: true` to your SKILL.md frontmatter when your skill produces terse output that benefits from the directive — see `koan/skills/README.md`.

#### Ponytail Code Minimalism

Ponytail is a complementary optimization that reduces the amount of **code** Claude generates (caveman reduces **prose** verbosity). When enabled, the agent prompt includes a six-gate decision ladder: Is it necessary? Does stdlib handle it? Is it a native feature? Does an existing dep cover it? Can it be a one-liner? Only then write new code.

Ponytail is **enabled by default**. To disable it:

```yaml
optimizations:
  ponytail:
    enabled: false
```

### Per-Project Overrides

Projects are configured in `projects.yaml` at `KOAN_ROOT`. Repositories under
`KOAN_ROOT/workspace/<name>` are also discovered automatically as projects;
add a `projects.yaml` entry when you need overrides such as model selection,
tracker routing, or a project name that differs from the directory name. Each
project can override defaults:

```yaml
defaults:
  git_auto_merge:
    enabled: false
    strategy: squash

projects:
  webapp:
    path: ~/Code/webapp
    cli_provider: claude       # CLI provider override
    models:
      mission: opus            # Use Opus for this project
      review_mode: sonnet      # Use Sonnet for review mode and /review
    tools:
      blocked: [WebSearch]     # Restrict certain tools
    git_auto_merge:
      enabled: true            # Auto-merge for this project
      strategy: squash
    issue_tracker:
      provider: jira           # github | jira
      jira_project: PROJ       # Jira project key for ticket routing
      jira_issue_type: Task    # Default type for issues Koan creates
      default_branch: main     # Target branch for Jira-triggered work
    authorized_users:          # Who can trigger via GitHub @mention
      - username1
```

Key per-project settings:
- **`cli_provider`** — `claude`, `cline`, `codex`, `copilot`, `local`, or `ollama-launch`
- **`models`** — Override model selection per role
- **`tools`** — Restrict available tools
- **`git_auto_merge`** — Auto-merge completed PRs (strategy: squash/merge/rebase)
- **`issue_tracker`** — Issue provider routing for GitHub/Jira-backed projects
- **`security_review`** — Automatic diff analysis for dangerous patterns before auto-merge (see below)
- **`review_verdict`** — Control formal APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES verdict submission (see below)
- **`private_review_gate`** — Override the private `/fix`, `/implement`, and `/rebase` post-PR review/fix loop
- **`authorized_users`** — GitHub users allowed to trigger via @mention
- **`exploration`** — Enable/disable autonomous exploration

#### Security Review

When enabled, Kōan scans mission diffs for security-sensitive patterns before auto-merge:
- **Blast radius** — files changed, modules affected, infrastructure/dependency changes
- **Content patterns** — eval, exec, shell injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe deserialization, XSS, wildcard CORS, etc.
- **Risk classification** — low / medium / high / critical based on cumulative score

Results are logged to the project journal. In blocking mode, auto-merge is skipped when the risk level meets or exceeds the configured threshold.

```yaml
defaults:
  security_review:
    enabled: true              # Scan diffs for dangerous patterns
    blocking: false            # true = block auto-merge on high risk
    severity_threshold: high   # low / medium / high / critical
```

Per-project override example:
```yaml
projects:
  production-api:
    security_review:
      enabled: true
      blocking: true           # Block auto-merge for risky changes
      severity_threshold: medium
```

See [docs/security/security-review.md](../security/security-review.md) for the full list of detected patterns, risk scoring details, and pipeline integration.

#### Review Verdict

Controls the formal APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES verdict submitted via the GitHub Pull Request Reviews API after `/review`. Review comments and PR feedback are always posted regardless of this setting.

```yaml
# instance/config.yaml
review_verdict:
  approved: true              # Submit the verdict status (default: true)
                               # Set to false to skip the formal verdict entirely
  body_enabled: true           # Include a body with the verdict (default: true)
  include_blockers: true       # List blocking finding titles in REQUEST_CHANGES body
```

Per-project override in `projects.yaml`:
```yaml
projects:
  sensitive-repo:
    review_verdict:
      approved: false          # Comments only, no formal GitHub verdict
```

When `approved: false`, the bot still posts review comments and PR feedback but skips the formal GitHub review status (green check / red X in the Reviewers panel). Configuration errors are fail-closed: if loading project overrides fails, or if the `review_verdict` section is malformed (non-dict value or non-boolean entries for known keys), the verdict is skipped to preserve operator intent.

GitHub forbids APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES on a PR you authored (HTTP 422). When Kōan reviews its own PR, the verdict body is automatically posted as a `COMMENT` review instead, so the feedback still appears in the Reviewers panel rather than being lost to a submission error.

**Inline comments (opt-in):** Set `review_inline_comments.enabled: true` in `config.yaml` to also post each finding as an inline PR comment anchored to its code location, in addition to the bucketed summary comment (which is unchanged). Each inline thread shows the same severity marker (🔴/🟡/🟢) and the full finding detail, so reviewers can react or resolve in place. Cap the volume with `review_inline_comments.max_comments` (default 25). Disabled by default; findings without a resolvable line, or reviews with no head SHA, are skipped. Re-running `/review` is idempotent — findings already anchored on the PR are not re-posted. Multi-line findings anchor to their full range. If findings exist but every inline post fails, Kōan notifies you instead of failing silently.

```yaml
review_inline_comments:
  enabled: false        # Master switch (default: false)
  max_comments: 25      # Cap inline threads posted per review (default: 25)
```

### Custom Skills

Kōan's skill system is fully extensible. Install skills from Git repos or create your own.

**Install from Git:**
```
/skill install https://github.com/your-org/koan-skills.git
/skill approve <scope> <fingerprint>
/skill update <scope>
/skill remove <scope>
```

Freshly installed and scaffolded skills are **quarantined** until you approve
them. Kōan replies with a short hex fingerprint of the on-disk files; loaded
handlers are skipped by the registry until you run `/skill approve` with that
fingerprint. This blocks blind / prompt-injected installs from running code in
the bridge process. Inspect the files in `instance/skills/<scope>/` first.

Optional `config.yaml` allow-list to refuse clones outside trusted hosts
(defense-in-depth; the approval gate still applies if you do not set it):

```yaml
skills:
  allowed_hosts:
    - github.com/your-org
```

**Create your own:** Add a `SKILL.md` file in `instance/skills/<scope>/<name>/`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
scope: my-scope
description: What this skill does
audience: bridge
commands:
  - name: mycommand
    description: One-line description
    usage: /mycommand <args>
handler: handler.py
---
```

The handler follows a simple pattern:

```python
def handle(ctx):
    # ctx.args — command arguments
    # ctx.project — current project
    # ctx.instance_dir — instance directory path
    return "Response message"  # or None for no reply
```

For prompt-only skills (no handler), put the prompt text after the YAML frontmatter — it's sent directly to Claude.

**Scaffold a skill from a description:**

Instead of writing SKILL.md and handler.py by hand, use `/scaffold_skill` to generate them:

```
/scaffold_skill myteam deploy Deploy to production with rollback support
```

This invokes Claude to produce a valid SKILL.md + handler.py stub in `instance/skills/myteam/deploy/`, validated against the parser before writing. Restart the bridge to load the new skill.

See [koan/skills/README.md](../../koan/skills/README.md) for the full authoring guide.

### GitHub @mention Integration

Ten skills can be triggered by commenting `@koan-bot <command>` on GitHub issues and PRs:

| Skill | GitHub trigger |
|-------|---------------|
| `/brainstorm` | `@koan-bot /brainstorm <topic>` on an issue |
| `/implement` | `@koan-bot /implement` on an issue |
| `/fix` | `@koan-bot /fix` on an issue |
| `/debug` | `@koan-bot /debug` on an issue |
| `/review` | `@koan-bot /review` on a PR |
| `/rebase` | `@koan-bot /rebase` on a PR |
| `/reviewrebase` | `@koan-bot /rr` on a PR |
| `/planimplement` | `@koan-bot /planit` on an issue |
| `/recreate` | `@koan-bot /recreate` on a PR |
| `/refactor` | `@koan-bot /refactor` on a PR or issue |
| `/plan` | `@koan-bot /plan <idea>` on an issue |
| `/profile` | `@koan-bot /profile` on a PR or issue |

Setup requires configuring `github_nickname` and `github_commands_enabled` in `config.yaml`. See [docs/messaging/github-commands.md](../messaging/github-commands.md) for full setup and configuration details.

### CLI Providers

Kōan supports multiple CLI backends. Configure globally via `KOAN_CLI_PROVIDER` env var or per-project in `projects.yaml`.

| Provider | Best for | Docs |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Claude Code** (default) | Full-featured agent, best reasoning | [claude.md](../providers/claude.md) |
| **Cline** | Multi-backend (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI) | [cline.md](../providers/cline.md) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | ChatGPT users who want Codex models | [codex.md](../providers/codex.md) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Teams with existing Copilot licenses | [copilot.md](../providers/copilot.md) |
| **Ollama Launch** | Local/offline models behind the Claude CLI harness | [ollama-launch.md](../providers/ollama-launch.md) |
| **OpenRouter** (via Claude CLI) | Claude CLI behavior with OpenRouter's model catalog/billing | [openrouter.md](../providers/openrouter.md) |

#### Provider-specific model config

When switching between providers, model names are not interchangeable. Use `models.{provider}:` sections in `instance/config.yaml` to configure provider-specific defaults without touching the global `models.default:` fallback:

```yaml
cli_provider: "codex"

models:
  # Provider-specific overrides (resolved before models.default)
  codex:
    mission: "gpt-5.5"
    chat: "gpt-5.5"
    lightweight: "gpt-5.4-mini"
    fallback: ""              # empty = use provider default
    review_mode: "gpt-5.3-codex"
    reflect: "gpt-5.5"

  claude:
    review_mode: "haiku"      # use haiku for cheaper REVIEW mode audits

  ollama-launch:
    mission: "qwen2.5-coder:14b"
    chat: "qwen2.5-coder:14b"
    lightweight: "qwen2.5-coder:7b"

  # Global fallback for providers without a specific section
  default:
    lightweight: "haiku"
    fallback: "sonnet"
```

Resolution order per key: per-project `models:` → `models.{provider}:` → `models.default:` → built-in default. Provider names may use hyphens or underscores. The legacy flat `models:` / `models_for_{provider}:` layout still works but emits a one-time `DEPRECATED` warning at startup. See [Model Configuration](model-configuration.md) for the full migration guide.

Use `/models` to inspect the resolved values for the active provider at any time.

### Language Preference

**`/language`** — Set or reset the reply language.

- **Usage:** `/language <lang>`, `/language reset`
- **Aliases:** `/lng`

**`/french`** / **`/english`** — Quick language switches.

- **Aliases:** `/fr`, `/francais`, `/français` / `/en`, `/anglais`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/fr` — Switch to French replies
- `/en` — Switch back to English
- `/language reset` — Use default language
</details>

### System Management

**`/pause`** — Pause mission processing. Kōan stays running but won't pick up new missions.

- **Aliases:** `/sleep`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/pause` — Temporarily stop mission work without shutting down
- Resume with `/resume` when ready
</details>

**`/resume`** — Resume mission processing after a pause (manual or automatic).

- **Aliases:** `/work`, `/awake`, `/run`, `/start`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/resume` — Unpause after a manual `/pause` or quota exhaustion
</details>

**`/shutdown`** — Shutdown both the agent loop and the messaging bridge.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/shutdown` — Gracefully stop everything (e.g., before system maintenance)
</details>

**`/update`** — Update to the latest commit on main, then restart.

- **Aliases:** `/upgrade`
- Pulls the latest code from upstream/main (fast-forward only) and restarts.
- Waits for the current mission to complete before pulling.
- If the update fails, Kōan still restarts (you asked for it).
- Use `/restart` if you just need a fresh start without pulling code.

**`/update_last_release`** — Update to the most recent release tag, then restart.

- Checks out the latest release tag instead of pulling the latest commit on main.
- Recommended when you want a stable, tagged release rather than the bleeding edge.
- When a new release tag is detected, Kōan's notification suggests this command.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/update` — "Pull the latest code from main and restart"
- `/upgrade` — Same as `/update`
- `/update_last_release` — "Switch to the most recent tagged release"
</details>

**`/reset`** — Reset the run counter to 0 without restarting. If Kōan is paused because it reached `max_runs`, `/reset` also resumes execution.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/reset` — Reset counter mid-session when you want more runs
- `/reset` — Resume from a max_runs pause without losing current state
</details>

**`/restart`** — Restart both agent and bridge processes without pulling new code.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/restart` — Force a restart when Kōan is already up to date but you need a fresh start
</details>

**`/snapshot`** — Export memory state to a portable snapshot file for backup or migration.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/snapshot` — Back up Kōan's memory before a major change
</details>

### Memory System

Kōan maintains persistent memory across sessions through several interconnected files:

- **`memory/summary.md`** — Global summary of learnings across all projects
- **`memory/projects/<name>/`** — Per-project learnings and context
- **`journal/YYYY-MM-DD/project.md`** — Daily logs of what Kōan did
- **`soul.md`** — Agent personality definition (see [Personality Customization](#personality-customization))

Memory is automatically compacted over time. Kōan uses it to build context for each mission, remembering past decisions, patterns, and mistakes.

#### Memory Compaction

Kōan runs automatic memory maintenance every 24 hours (configurable) during the startup cleanup cycle:

1. **Learnings dedup** — Removes exact-duplicate lines from `learnings.md` files
2. **Semantic compaction** — Uses Claude (lightweight model) to merge redundant entries, remove references to deleted code, and consolidate by topic. Cross-references the project's file tree to identify obsolete entries.
3. **Hard cap** — Safety-net truncation that keeps only the most recent entries if the file is still too large after compaction
4. **Global memory rotation** — Truncates append-only files (`personality-evolution.md`, `emotional-memory.md`) to prevent unbounded growth

Configure thresholds in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
memory:
  learnings_max_lines: 100        # Target after semantic compaction
  learnings_hard_cap: 200         # Absolute max (safety net)
  global_personality_max: 150     # Max lines for personality-evolution.md
  global_emotional_max: 100       # Max lines for emotional-memory.md
  compaction_interval_hours: 24   # How often cleanup runs
```

Manual compaction via CLI: `python3 memory_manager.py <instance_dir> compact-learnings [project]`

Edit `instance/soul.md` to define Kōan's personality. This file shapes how Kōan communicates, what tone it uses, and what personality traits it exhibits. It's loaded into every interaction.

The design principle: code is generic and open source; instance data (including personality) is private. Fork the repo, write your own soul.

### CI Check System

The CI check system monitors your PRs for CI failures and can automatically attempt fixes. It includes CI queue draining (after `/rebase`), auto-dispatch of fix missions, and the `/ci_check` skill. Enabled by default — disable to save tokens if you don't need CI monitoring.

```yaml
ci_check:
  enabled: true              # Master switch (default: true)
```

When disabled, all CI-related automation is skipped: queue draining, CI dispatch, CI enqueue after rebase, and the `/ci_check` command returns an error.

### CI Dispatch

Kōan can automatically create fix missions when CI fails on its own PRs. When enabled, each iteration checks open Koan-authored PRs for failing check runs and inserts a fix mission with the failure log snippet. Dedup prevents re-dispatching the same failure. Only active when `ci_check.enabled` is true.

```yaml
ci_dispatch:
  enabled: true              # Master switch (default: false)
  cooldown_minutes: 30       # Min time between checks per project (default: 30)
  log_snippet_bytes: 4096    # Max CI log snippet in mission text (default: 4096, floored at 64)
  tracker_max_age_days: 30   # Prune dedup entries older than this (default: 30)
```

### Auto-Update

Kōan notifies you via Telegram when a new release tag appears upstream (throttled to 48 h). Run `/update_last_release` to switch to the tagged release, or `/update` to pull the latest commit on main.

Optionally, you can enable automatic pulling in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
auto_update:
  enabled: false          # Opt-in only — set to true to auto-pull
  check_interval: 10      # Check every N iterations (default: 10)
  notify: true            # Notify on Telegram before/after update
```

See [docs/operations/auto-update.md](../operations/auto-update.md) for details.

</details>

### Codebase Audit

**`/audit`** — Audit a project for optimizations, simplifications, and potential issues. Creates a GitHub issue for each finding with detailed problem description, impact analysis, suggested fix, and severity/effort classification.

- **Usage:** `/audit <project-name> [extra context] [limit=N]`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /audit` on an issue or PR
- Default: top 5 most important findings. Use `limit=N` to override.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/audit webapp focus on the auth module` — Audit with specific focus
- `/audit mylib look for performance bottlenecks limit=10` — Targeted audit with custom limit
</details>

Each finding becomes a GitHub issue with:
- **Problem** — What's wrong and why it matters
- **Why This Matters** — Impact on bugs, performance, or maintainability
- **Suggested Fix** — Concrete description of what to change
- **Details table** — Severity, category, location, and effort estimate

### Security Audit

**`/security_audit`** — Perform a security-focused SDLC audit of a project. Searches for critical vulnerabilities (injection, auth flaws, secrets exposure, path traversal, SSRF, insecure deserialization, etc.) and creates a GitHub issue for each finding.

- **Usage:** `/security_audit <project-name> [extra context] [limit=N]`
- **Aliases:** `/security`, `/secu`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /security_audit` on an issue or PR
- Default: top 5 most critical findings. Use `limit=N` to override.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/security_audit koan` — Full security audit (top 5 critical findings)
- `/security myapp focus on the API endpoints` — Security audit with specific focus
- `/secu webapp limit=3` — Quick security scan with custom limit
</details>

Each finding becomes a GitHub issue with:
- **Problem** — The vulnerability and how it could be exploited
- **Why This Matters** — Real-world impact (data breach, RCE, privilege escalation)
- **Suggested Fix** — Concrete remediation steps
- **Details table** — Severity, category, location, and effort estimate

**Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVRS):** When the target repository has GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting enabled, critical and high severity findings are automatically submitted as private security advisories instead of public issues. This prevents disclosure of exploitable vulnerabilities before a fix is applied. Lower-severity findings still create public issues.

Configure PVRS behavior per-project in `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  security:
    pvrs: auto          # auto (detect), true (force), false (public only)
    pvrs_threshold: high # minimum severity for PVRS (critical, high, medium, low)
projects:
  myapp:
    security:
      pvrs: false  # always use public issues for this project
```

### Private Security Audit

**`/private_security_audit`** — Same security analysis as `/security_audit`, but findings are written **only** to today's project journal. Nothing is posted to GitHub: no public issues, no Private Vulnerability Reports. Use this when you want a security review without disclosing any details to GitHub — for example, while triaging a sensitive area before deciding what to share.

- **Usage:** `/private_security_audit <project-name> [extra context] [limit=N]`
- **Aliases:** `/private_security`, `/psecu`
- Default: top 5 most critical findings. Use `limit=N` to override.
- **Output:** appended to `instance/journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<project>.md` under a `🔒 Private Security Audit` heading, plus a summary file at `instance/memory/projects/<project>/private_security_audit.md`.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/private_security_audit koan` — Full audit, findings stay local
- `/psecu webapp focus on token handling limit=3` — Focused review, kept off GitHub
</details>

### Full Audit Suite

**`/audit_all`** — Run `/security_audit`, `/dead_code`, and `/profile` in parallel. All three missions are batch-inserted atomically into the Pending queue, so they run as soon as slots are available without waiting for each other.

- **Usage:** `/audit_all [project-name]`
- **Alias:** `/aa`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/audit_all koan` — Queue all three audit skills for the koan project
- `/aa` — Quick shortcut for the default project
</details>

### Incident Triage

**`/incident`** — Triage a production error from a stack trace or log snippet. Kōan will parse the error, identify the root cause, propose a fix with tests, and submit a draft PR.

- **Usage:** `/incident <error text or stack trace>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/incident TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined at UserService.getUser (user.js:42)` — Paste a stack trace and get a fix
</details>

### Interactive launcher (`make koan`)

`make koan` is the interactive way to start Kōan. On first launch, if no
`instance/` exists or onboarding progress is waiting in `.koan-onboarding.json`,
it runs the CLI onboarding wizard before starting anything. After setup, it
starts the stack and drops you straight into the terminal dashboard. The home
screen is the **Status** tab (KŌAN hero + live flags), alongside **Logs**,
**Config**, and **Usage** tabs.

Single-tap toggles (accent dot `◉` on / `○` off):

- **`w` — web dashboard**: start/stop the web UI and open your browser at
  `localhost:5001`.
- **`k` — keep awake**: runs `caffeinate -s` (macOS) or `systemd-inhibit`
  (Linux) so your machine doesn't sleep while Kōan works. On by default; tap
  `k` to turn it off.

Keys: `1`–`4` (or `s`/`l`/`u`/`c`) switch tabs; `m` queues a new mission; in
Config, arrows browse the tree, Enter edits a value, `t` toggles a boolean;
`p` pauses, `r` reloads. `d` **detaches** (closes the dashboard, leaves Kōan
running); `q` **quits** and stops Kōan (with a confirmation). When stdin is not
a TTY (services, CI, pipes)
`make koan` falls back to the headless path with no prompt. `make start` is
unchanged and remains the launcher used by services and scripts.

The terminal dashboard requires `textual` (installed by `make setup`); if it is
missing, Kōan stays running and you can follow it with `make logs`.

### Web Dashboard

Run `make dashboard` to start a local web UI on port 5001. The dashboard provides:

- Real-time status overview
- Mission queue management
- Chat interface
- Journal browsing

The dashboard binds to `localhost` only — not accessible from the network.

### Deployment

- [Docker deployment](../setup/docker.md)
- [SSH tunnel setup](../setup/ssh-setup.md)
- [Always-up Railway deployment](../design/spec-always-up-railway.md)
