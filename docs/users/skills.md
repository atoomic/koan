## Mission Management

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|

| `/priority <n> <pos>` | — | Reorder a pending mission in the queue |
| `/cancel <n or keyword>` | `/remove`, `/clear` | Cancel a pending mission |
| `/abort` | — | Abort the current in-progress mission |
| `/idea <text>` | `/ideas`, `/buffer` | Add to the ideas backlog (promote to mission later) |

## Recurring Missions

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/daily <text>` | — | Schedule a daily recurring mission |
| `/hourly <text>` | — | Schedule an hourly recurring mission |
| `/weekly <text>` | — | Schedule a weekly recurring mission |
| `/recurring` | — | List all recurring missions |
| `/recurring resume <n>` | — | Re-enable a disabled recurring mission |
| `/recurring run [n]` | — | Force an immediate run of a recurring mission |
| `/recurring pause <n>` | — | Disable a recurring mission without deleting |
| `/recurring cancel <n>` | — | Remove a recurring mission |
| `/recurring days <n> <days>` | — | Set a day-of-week filter on a recurring mission |

## Code & Project Operations

| Command | Aliases | Description | GitHub @mention |
|---------|---------|-------------|:-:|
| `/plan [--iterations N] <desc>` | — | Deep-think an idea, create a tracker issue with task-level plan (file map, checkbox steps, code blocks, self-review). `--iterations N` (1-5) runs N critique+refine rounds. Loads project MCP servers when `plan` is in `mcp_roles` (default). | — |
| `/deepplan <desc>` | `/deeplan` | Spec-first design: explore approaches, post spec, queue /plan | — |
| `/implement <issue>` | `/impl` | Queue implementation for a GitHub or Jira issue; creates a draft PR, then privately reviews/fixes Important+ findings by default | Yes |
| `/fix <issue>` | — | Diagnose → understand → plan → test → implement → submit PR, then privately reviews/fixes Important+ findings by default. Use `--skip-diagnose` to bypass the diagnostic. A PR URL is redirected to `/rebase --fix` (preserving `--now` and trailing context) so review feedback is addressed on the same branch — including a GitHub `@bot fix` on a PR, which force-pushes the existing branch and never opens a new PR | Yes |
| `/debug <issue>` | `/dbg` | Structured 4-step debug loop: reproduce → hypothesize → minimal fix → verify. Auto-queued when `/fix` fails (opt-in via `debug_escalation.on_fix_failure` in config.yaml) | Yes |
| `/review <PR> [PR ...] [--bot-comments]` | `/rv`, `/rereview`, `/re_review` | Review one or more pull requests; each URL queues a separate review mission. `--bot-comments` triages bot findings | Yes |
| `/ultrareview <PR>` | `/urv` | Ultra-thorough review: architecture + silent-failure passes combined | Yes |
| `/explain <PR>` | `/xp` | Explain a PR's changes in plain language with examples and alternative approaches | Yes |
| `/rebase [--fix] <PR> [focus area]` | `/rb` | Rebase a PR onto its base branch. **By default rebases only.** Add `--fix` to also address review feedback (implied when you add a focus area or severity keyword after the URL); trailing text is threaded into the mission as focus context | Yes |
| `/squash <PR>` | `/sq` | Squash all PR commits into one clean commit | Yes |
| `/recreate <PR>` | `/rc` | Re-implement a PR from scratch on a fresh branch | Yes |
| `/refactor <desc>` | `/rf` | Targeted refactoring mission | Yes |
| `/check <url>` | `/inspect` | Run project health checks on a PR or issue (rebase, review, plan) | — |
| `/check_need <url>` | `/need`, `/needs` | Analyze if a PR or issue is still needed vs. current main | — |
| `/ci_check <PR>\|--enable\|--disable` | — | Check and fix CI failures on a PR (non-blocking, bounded, one attempt per mission); toggle CI system | — |
| `/pr <PR>` | — | Review and update a GitHub pull request | — |
| `/claudemd [project] [learnings]` | `/claude`, `/claude.md` | Refresh or create a project's CLAUDE.md, or sync Kōan's learnings into it | — |
| `/doc <project> [cats]` | `/docs` | Extract structured documentation to docs/ | Yes |
| `/profile <project>` | `/perf`, `/benchmark` | Performance profiling mission | Yes |

For URL-based `/plan`, `/deepplan`, `/implement`, and `/fix`, append `branch:<name>` to
override the base branch for that mission.

`plan` runs with the project's MCP servers loaded when `plan` is in `mcp_roles`
(the default), so it can consult MCP-backed trackers and knowledge bases. See
[docs/providers/claude.md](../providers/claude.md) → "Per-role MCP access".
Conversational roles (`chat`, `github_reply`) stay excluded by default; add them
to `mcp_roles` to opt in. `mcp_roles: []` is a kill switch for every role.

**Assumptions audit (advisory, never blocks):** before a `/plan` result is posted, a
lightweight auditor pressure-tests the plan's hidden assumptions; unverified-critical
ones are folded into the plan's *Open Questions* section so you can resolve them on
the issue. When `/implement` runs, the same audit's findings are injected into the
implementation context as "verify before coding" guidance — the mission always
proceeds. Toggle with `plan_review.assumptions_check` in `config.yaml` (default on).

The private post-PR review gate for `/fix`, `/implement`, and `/rebase` is
backend-only: it reuses `/review` analysis, fixes Blocking/Important findings
on the same branch, and does not post review comments or verdicts. It is
opt-in (disabled by default during the testing phase) — enable and configure it
with `private_review_gate` in `config.yaml` or `projects.yaml`.

`/review` (and the private gate) inject the project's filtered learnings and
human-curated context/priorities into the review prompt, ranked against the PR
content. Enable `review_memory` in `config.yaml` to also include recent typed
project memory (decisions, observations) from the SQLite memory index.

**Inline comments (opt-in):** Set `review_inline_comments.enabled: true` in
`config.yaml` to also post each finding as an inline PR comment anchored to its
code location, in addition to the bucketed summary comment (which is unchanged).
Each inline thread shows the same severity marker (🔴/🟡/🟢) and the full finding
detail, so reviewers can react or resolve in place. Cap the volume with
`review_inline_comments.max_comments` (default 25). Re-running `/review` is
idempotent (already-anchored findings are skipped); multi-line findings anchor
to their full range; if all posts fail, you are notified. Disabled by default.

**Verdict consistency:** The formal APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES state and its
green/red/yellow alert are derived from the final bucketed findings. Reflection
cannot leave a failed checklist item pointing at a hidden finding, and Kōan will
not submit REQUEST_CHANGES unless the summary lists at least one 🔴 Blocking or
🟡 Important finding.

**Stale-HEAD alert:** the review comment's footer shows the commit it was run
against (`HEAD=<short-sha>`). A review can take minutes, and you may push (or
force-push) new commits meanwhile. If the branch tip moved between when the
review started and when the comment is posted, Kōan appends an **IMPORTANT**
banner to the comment noting that the findings predate your latest push — so you
don't act on stale feedback. Re-run `/review` to cover the new commits. Nothing
changes for the common case where the branch didn't move.

**Consistent reviews (no whiplash).** Re-running `/review` is stable, not a fresh
roll of the dice:

- **Unchanged code → reproduced.** If the PR head *and* base are unchanged since
  the last review and you ask for the same kind of review, Kōan reproduces the
  prior review instead of re-analysing (so the findings don't drift). Turn off via
  `review_consistency.reuse_enabled: false`.
- **Fix-and-push → no new complaints on untouched code.** After you fix findings
  and push, a re-review won't suddenly raise *new* non-critical issues on files you
  didn't touch — those should have been caught the first time (and the review now
  aims to catch everything in one pass). Only a genuine **critical** on pre-existing
  code still surfaces, marked `[Pre-Existing Issue]`. Turn off via
  `review_consistency.freeze_enabled: false`.

**Trustworthy 🟡 Important tier.** The yellow (blocking) tier is reserved for issues
that clearly should block merge; borderline "should-fix" items are demoted to 🟢
recommendations and don't block the PR. Issues that **predate your PR** are shown as
🟢 `[Pre-Existing Issue]` recommendations (a pre-existing critical keeps its severity
but is still labeled), so you're not blocked for code you didn't write.

**Your comments are honored.** On a re-review, if a human comment says a finding
should be ignored / isn't a problem, Kōan won't re-raise it as a blocker; if a
comment says "fix later", the finding becomes a non-blocking `[Deferred]`
recommendation. The change is always attributed to the commenter. Disable with
`review_dispositions.enabled: false`.

**Comprehensive mode (opt-in).** Set `review_discovery.enabled: true` (per-instance
or per-project) for a more thorough multi-perspective pass that catches more in a
single review (higher token/time cost). Off by default — the normal `/review` is
unchanged.

**Large diffs & partial-coverage warning:** Review diffs are packed to fit a
token budget by the diff compressor (`optimizations.review_compressor.token_budget`,
default 80,000 tokens — the single knob controlling review diff size). The
fetch-time character cap is *derived* from that budget (budget × 3.5 chars/token
× 4 headroom), so the compressor — not a blind character cut — decides coverage
on large-context models. If the compressor is disabled, a token-safe backstop
(budget × 3.5, no headroom) truncates the diff instead, so the size guard holds
in every config. Whenever any file is omitted (fetch-time backstop,
compressor packing, or trivial-file triage), the posted review opens with a
`⚠️ Partial review` block listing every omitted file, so partial coverage is
never silent.

Skills marked **GitHub @mention** can be triggered by commenting `@koan-bot <command>` on a PR or issue. See [GitHub commands](../messaging/github-commands.md).

## Skill Types

- **Instant** (`worker: false`) — Executes immediately, returns a response. Examples: `/status`, `/list`, `/gha_audit`.
- **Worker** (`worker: true`) — Runs in a background thread (Claude calls, API requests). Examples: `/magic`, `/chat`, `/sparring`.
- **Hybrid** (`audience: hybrid`) — Available from both Telegram/Slack and as agent-dispatched skills. Examples: `/plan`, `/implement`, `/review`.

## Custom Skills

Install skills from Git repos:

```
/skill install https://github.com/your-org/koan-skills.git
/skill approve <scope> <fingerprint>
/skill update <scope>
/skill remove <scope>
```

New installs and `/scaffold_skill` output are **quarantined** behind an
approval gate — the registry will not load them until `/skill approve` is run
with the fingerprint shown in the install reply. Inspect the cloned files
before approving. Set `skills.allowed_hosts` in `config.yaml` to restrict
which Git hosts `/skill install` can fetch from.

Or create your own in `instance/skills/<scope>/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` file. See [koan/skills/README.md](../../koan/skills/README.md) for the full authoring guide.
